## Overview

All tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and are located in the `tests/` directory. The suite includes both unit and integration tests, with extensive use of fixtures, factories, and custom assertion helpers to ensure isolation and reproducibility.

- **unit/**: Unit tests for individual modules and classes.
- **integration/**: Integration tests for orchestrator and end-to-end workflows.
- **fixtures/**: Data and object factories for generating test data.
- **helpers/**: Custom assertion functions and mock utilities.
- **conftest.py**: Shared pytest fixtures and configuration.

## How to Run Tests

From the project root, run:

```bash
pytest
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
pytest tests/unit/test_article_manager.py
```

To run only integration tests:

```bash
pytest tests/integration/
```

To see verbose output:

```bash
pytest -v
```

---

## Test Coverage

To check code coverage (requires `pytest-cov`):

```bash
pytest --cov=financial_news_rag
```

A summary will be printed in the terminal. Aim for at least 80% coverage. For a detailed HTML report:

```bash
pytest --cov=financial_news_rag --cov-report=html
```

Open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser to view the report.

## Fixtures, Factories, and Helpers

### Fixtures (`conftest.py`)

- **Configuration and Environment**: `test_config`, `temp_directory`, `temp_db_path`
- **Component Instances**: `article_manager`, `chroma_manager`
- **Mocked Components**: `mock_eodhd_client`, `mock_text_processor`, `mock_embeddings_generator`, `mock_chroma_manager`, `mock_reranker`, `mock_article_manager`
- **Orchestrator Mocks**: `mock_orchestrator_components`, `orchestrator_with_mocks`
- **Test Data**: `sample_article`, `sample_articles_list`, `sample_processed_chunks`, `sample_embeddings`, `sample_chroma_results`, `sample_html_content`, etc.
- **Parameterized Fixtures**: `tag_parameter`, `symbol_parameter`, `status_parameter`
- **Utility Fixtures**: `assert_article_stored`, `assert_chunks_in_chroma`

Fixtures are automatically injected into tests as needed, providing isolation and reproducibility.

### Factories (`fixtures/factories.py`, `fixtures/sample_data.py`)

- **ArticleFactory**: Generates realistic article dictionaries with random or specified fields.
- **ChunkFactory**: Generates text chunks and embeddings.
- **TestScenarioFactory**: Builds complex, multi-component test scenarios.
- **ConfigDataFactory**: Produces environment variable sets for config testing.

Factories allow for flexible, repeatable test data generation.

### Helpers (`helpers/assertions.py`, `helpers/mock_helpers.py`)

- **assertions.py**: Custom assertion functions for validating article structure, processing status, embedding status, database statistics, and ChromaDB results.
- **mock_helpers.py**: Utilities for setting up test environments, mocks, and common operations.

---

## Test Types

- **Unit Tests**: Located in `tests/unit/`. Test individual classes and functions in isolation, using mocks and fixtures.
- **Integration Tests**: Located in `tests/integration/`. Test the orchestrator and full pipeline, using real implementations and mocked external APIs.
- **End-to-End Scenarios**: Some integration tests simulate realistic workflows, including fetching, processing, embedding, storing, and searching articles.

---

## Best Practices

- Use fixtures and factories for all test data and component setup.
- Mock external APIs (EODHD, Gemini) to avoid network calls and costs.
- Use custom assertion helpers for clear, domain-specific test validation.
- Keep tests isolated and idempotentâ€”no test should depend on the outcome of another.
- Maintain high coverage and add tests for new features and bug fixes.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If tests fail due to missing dependencies, install them with:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- For database or file-related errors, ensure tests are using temporary paths and not writing to production data.
- Use `pytest -s` to see print/debug output during test runs.
