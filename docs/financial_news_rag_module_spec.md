# Financial News RAG Module - Project Specification

## Project Overview

This project implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module specialized for processing and analyzing financial news. The module will fetch, store, and enable semantic search over financial news articles, providing relevant context to other systems, such as an investment portfolio management system.

## Core Objectives

1.  Fetch financial news articles from specified APIs (e.g., NewsAPI).
2.  Process and clean the text content of news articles.
3.  Generate embeddings for news articles.
4.  Store news articles and their embeddings in a vector database (ChromaDB).
5.  Provide an API or interface for semantic search over the news articles.
6.  Implement re-ranking of retrieved documents using an advanced LLM to ensure high relevance.
7.  Implement automated data update scripts to keep the news database current.
8.  Ensure the module is easily integrable into larger financial analysis systems.

## Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **Embedding Model**: A suitable model for generating embeddings (e.g., from Hugging Face Sentence Transformers).
- **Re-ranking LLM**: An advanced LLM (e.g., OpenAI API, local models) for re-ranking search results.
- **LLM Integration (for potential summarization/analysis within the module, optional)**: OpenAI API or local models.
- **Text Processing**: Standard Python libraries (e.g., `nltk`, `beautifulsoup4` for cleaning if needed).

### Data Sources

- Financial news via NewsAPI (or other configurable news APIs).

### Data Management

- Vector database (ChromaDB) for semantic search of news articles.
- Local filesystem for storing:
  - Configuration for news sources.
  - Logs for data fetching and processing.
- Automated data update scripts.

### Module Interface

- A Python API that allows:
  - Adding new news articles to the database.
  - Searching for news articles based on semantic queries.
  - Retrieving relevant news snippets or full articles.
- (Optional) A simple CLI for testing and maintenance.

## Integration with Portfolio Management System

This module is designed to be integrated into the main Investment Portfolio Management System. It will provide the Market Trends Specialist and other relevant agents with up-to-date, semantically relevant news data. The main system will query this module to:

- Gather context for market sentiment analysis.
- Identify news relevant to specific companies or sectors.
- Support event-driven analysis.

## Future Extensions

- Integration with more news sources.
- Advanced text analytics (e.g., sentiment scoring, entity recognition) directly within the module.
- Caching mechanisms for frequently accessed queries.
- User feedback loop for improving search relevance.
